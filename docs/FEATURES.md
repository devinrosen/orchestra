# Feature Requests

## Library

- [ ] **Rescan library for updates** — Once a library is loaded, there's no way to re-scan it to pick up new/changed/deleted files without restarting the app. Add a "Rescan" button that re-scans the current `libraryRoot` and updates the database incrementally.

## UI / UX

- [ ] **Expandable global status bar** — The global progress bar is compact and useful, but clicking it should expand an inline detail panel (not a full page navigation) showing: current file, files completed/total, bytes transferred, elapsed time, and an option to collapse back down.
- [ ] **Song and album metadata viewer/editor** — View and edit metadata (title, artist, album artist, album, track number, disc number, year, genre, album art) for individual tracks or in bulk for an album. Changes should write back to the audio files via lofty and update the database.

## Device Sync

- [ ] **Sync by album** — In addition to selecting artists, allow selecting individual albums to sync to a device. Useful for syncing a few albums from an artist with a large discography without pulling everything.
